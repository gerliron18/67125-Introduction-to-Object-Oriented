=============================
The design factor of this exercise has implemented for me by the course so I didn't get any options
to make a lot of considerations, above all that I chose to seperate between methods in order
to make the script more readable and easy to understand.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Library class, I had to implement some limitations at some methods so that the library will act
like a real library, for example- when book is returned to it, the method will check if the Id of
the book and so te patron is valid so in real life when the local library can add a book that was
in her position at first place.
